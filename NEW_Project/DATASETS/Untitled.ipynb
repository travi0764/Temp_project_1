Let me attempt to explain (probably unsuccessfully) to your shit for brains what I mean.  1) I\\'m sick and tired of idiots disrespecting the source material in the name of \"muh duh-ver-see-tee\" and virtue signaling. Particularly Americunts such as Hollywood. If you want to make your \"diverse utopia\", do it on your own, make up your own story, don\\'t bastardize existing source material. And it\\'s always - *always* - race swap from white to whatever other color and from male to female. Even if it doesn\\'t make *any* sense whatsoever and even if actually completely breaks the established lore which was the case with Idris Elba in The Dark Tower where racism was actually a big plot in the source material and in fact it was what you liberal morons would call \"reverse racism\" of a black person hating a white person for being white.  Another insane example is that batshit absurd bullshit remake they are trying to make of the Lord of the Flies with *all female cast*. In what universe does it make sense (well in your demented NPC brain it probably does) to convert the all male cast to all female cast and not destroy the core and the fundamental idea of the source material?   Well, \"diversifying\" the Witcher cast makes just about the same amount of sense (for people too stupid to breathe like you this means \"none\").  2) The Witcher is essentially the first or at least the most famous story that comes from Eastern Europe and popularizes our Slavic mythology and culture. I am an Eastern European Slav myself. And yes, it may come as a complete surprise to your \"progressive\" shit for brains, but we do have our own culture for about ~1500 years, give or take a few hundred. And let me tell you what hasn\\'t changed for these 15+ centuries. We don\\'t have \"diverse\" people. In fact we happen to be some of the whitest motherfuckers in existence, proly only the Scandinavians are whiter. I\\'m so very sorry it \"hurts\" your Western politically correct \"duh-ver-see-tee\" and \"inclusivity\" bullshit but this is **OUR** culture and if you don\\'t like it you can go fuck yourself, preferably with a rusty fork shoved deep inside your anus. I guess \"all cutlures are equal and beautiful\" except yours, yours is too white, we need to \"diversify\" it a little so we can pat ourselves on the back how \"progressive\" we are so that the western feminists social justice retards don\\'t REEEEEEEEE.  So what, we are not allowed to have our own culture? It\\'s not \"diverse\" and \"inclusive\" enough for you? Well, I\\'m sorry, but being the \"original slaves\" we didn\\'t have much time to \"diversify\" it so that early 21st century millennial NPCs won\\'t be triggered by our evil demonic \"whiteness\". I\\'m absolutely sure that you wouldn\\'t mind if we make a reboot of the African Shaka Zulu series and cast Channing Tatum in the role of King Shaka? I\\'m also absolutely certain that you loved Gods of Egypt and its \"authentic\" cast.  So just like you liberal lunatics love to spew this \"whitewashing\" crap, can I also ask to stop \"darkwashing\" **MY** culture? It\\'s not like Slavic culture is that popular and mainstream in the west. We have this one thing and you just have to fuck it all up because of your \"duh-ver-see-tee\" and \"progressive-ness\".  3) Triss canon hair color is not red, it\\'s chestnut, dumbass. And she is \"best girl\" (you NPCs really can\\'t meme) because I love her character from the books. She is my favorite character in the entire series. So your failed attempt at \"weeb shaming\" doesn\\'t really cut it, it only shows how shallow your shit for brains is and what ignorant moron you are.

For instance, [Surah An-Nur 24:31](https://quran.com/24/31)  says that women must cover themselves, but the extent at which they cover themselves is up for interpretation.  When the word of Allah says to do something, that word cannot change. Whereas in other Abrahamic faiths it can. An example is the entire book of Leviticus in Christianity becoming absolutely null and void over time. This would never happen in the Islamic faith because the entirety of the Quran the absolute true word and will of Allah.

It\\'s clear that you\\'re more of an emotional than a rational person, that\\'s alright, but can you maybe base a single argument on something i actually said instead of just assuming everything? I never said any of that. You\\'re assuming the cop thinks she\\'s a lethal threat. Again, i\\'m sorry, but that\\'s another dumb assumption. What is it with you and over the top assumptions? She is a threat, no one said anything about lethal. Ironic how easily you assume things about what i think but you can\\'t assume the cops handled the situation in a proper fashion before the video began. You really have no idea what you\\'re talking about, you\\'re only defending her because she\\'s such a fragile woman. Get over yourself, she abused a cop, this is justified by law and by public opinion. Crowd control is not something done only when crowds get aggressive, it\\'s always done in case crowds get aggressive. It\\'s called preventing a dangerous situation and it shouldn\\'t be that hard to fathom. She was already under arrest, don\\'t you understand that? She RESISTED ARREST. The didn\\'t punch her first, arrested her after. They arrested her, she didn\\'t comply with the arrest so they had to take physical actions. If you don\\'t even know what an arrest is it\\'s hard to talk reason with you. Arrest is verbal. When an officer says you\\'re under arrest, you are arrested. She bothers the cops, is pushed away, she hits the cop, he defends, then she\\'s arrested and then she hits the cop again, resisting arrest. You are one to talk about police violence, look at your own numbers and then look at ours, it\\'s clear to see that lethal force is astronomically less common here than in the USA. Punching someone who punches cops is standard procedure everywhere. Tackling is way more dangerous, cop will be on the floor in a vulnerable position. But you don\\'t understand anything about how police do their job so it\\'s logical your emotions get the best of you. The cops are better than the people they arrested. Those people were being aggressive in bars, the handcuffed the first person without problems, then made sure the woman wasn\\'t a threat anymore either. This woman, like you said, was in the wrong, and the cops were better. Cops should be better, and here they clearly were? The didn\\'t attack anyone unprovoked (woman did) they only retaliated (woman instigated multiple times) and they remained professional and controlled the situation. Your entire argument is based on me saying police are always right, funny thing is i never once said that. You are an emotional person and paint the worst picture of the cops, and me, in your head with all your assumptions. Your argument is based on zero facts. Non-lethal measures against aggressive people resisting arrest within reason is never excessive force. It\\'s amazing how you bend the facts so extremely. Everything you say \"i have told you\" i literally did not say and do not believe. You are arguing against an enemy you made up in your own head. Saying that police can\\'t act until there\\'s been a trial is ridiculous and you know that, don\\'t play dumb. Cops have to act in an instance to take out a threat to ensure the safety of themselves and others, they did the right thing and you can\\'t accept that because she\\'s only a fragile woman (who ATTACKED COPS MULTIPLE TIMES)', '10. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYOU don\\'t KNOW how much damage a drunk, I\\'d say already retarded without getting hit, woman can do.

If a girl gets \"raped\" while both parties are drunk surely you\\'d take the girls side and say it doesn\\'t matter that he was drunk! Same when there\\'s a drunk driver. Being drunk is no excuse. If one of my family members would be treated like that i would be extremely fucking mad yes. At them. For being such a fucking idiot to ATTACK a cop like that MULTIPLE TIMES.

Get that through your thick, dutch skull.  I already told you there is no context, you don’t know why the officer is beating your loved one, he just is. You don’t know if your wife/mother/aunt hit the officer. You simply walk in the room and see an officer beating the pulp out of them. But, I guess you’re totally fine with your own mother getting beat by an officer. You love your police MORE than you love your own mother. Thats sad. I feel bad for any close women in your life, considering you are not only totally fine with them getting beat— you’re totally fine with them getting beat *for no reason.* you’ll sit there and assume that the beating that they are getting is rightfully deserved, you’ll blame your own family member, dis-regard the situation and— irregardless of whether you know why they are getting beat or not. Thats fucking sad.   This woman is not a victim, but she does not deserve to get her face beat in by a cop. she deserves a jail sentence and she deserves to serve time. The fact that you think that all women deserve to get beat for throwing half-assed, drunken swats at someone is absolutely disgusting. I feel bad for the women in your life.

This situation is about a woman breaking the law and receiving an unnecessary beating because of it.  I asked you, if you saw your loved one being beat with no context, what would you think?   Your words, roughly:  “I would be mad. At them. (Your loved one) for being an idiot and assaulting an officer”  This, in turn, tells me that, no matter the situation, the cop is right. You don’t know if your loved one did something wrong, or something right.   Yet, some how, some way, the beating that they are receiving is *still* warranted. That was YOUR answer. Maybe think next time before you shoot yourself in the foot with your own answers. If you’re worried that I’m going to create some grand fantasy (which I didn’t, Everything above is my actual logic that was drawn from *your* answers) answer the question smarter. OR defer the question and don’t answer it at all!   How is that relevant to this video? It tells me that you think the police actually can do no wrong. That, under no circumstances, could an officer handle a situation better. That, no matter what this lady, or your loved one did, no matter how significant or insignificant the offense— if any offense— the beating that they are receiving is absolutely necessary in making sure that lawful justice is served.    That is disgusting. Good night. ', '16. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt doesn\\'t matter whether the cop is right or not. How. Can. You. Be. So. Dense. Even if the cop is wrong, you do what they say. Even if they\\'re wrong, you don\\'t abuse them. You\\'re deduction that i must think the cop is always right because i would be mad at my family for disrespecting and abusing an officer is so far fetched i don\\'t even want to read the rest of the comment. Something is wrong with your perception of logic. Yes i don\\'t know if they did anything wrong or not, this is not related to my reaction to them abusing an officer though. You say \"it tells me\" so fucking often, in every comment you assume what i think, every single time wrongly. I keep repeating that you\\'re making an enemy in your heard and play the victim, but it doesn\\'t get through to you. And then you have the audacity to tell me I\\'m putting words in YOUR mouth, get a grip come on. It doesn\\'t matter what the fuck you\\'ve done, it can be fucking nothing. If you don\\'t attack the Dutch police they won\\'t attack you, it\\'s that easy. Of course the beating is warrented if they ATTACKED THE COP FIRST. Which this entire thing is about. If there is absolute no context fuck yeah I\\'m picking the cops side, they are highly respected members of society like i mentioned fucking hours ago. Of course they can be wrong, but that doesn\\'t mean I\\'m not assuming they\\'re not with good reason. Funny how you try to get out of a losing argument by saying i should pretend there\\'s no context and make it about the completely irrelevant statement \"cops are always right\" , as this is about a video where there is clear context and the cop is clearly in the right. But to answer that specific question of yours: if i walk in a room, no context, and i see my family member assault an officer with no context what so ever, just like the video, and the cop retaliates, i am 100 percent picking the side of the law. I\\'ve been stating this over and over again and the fact that you think i shoot myself in the foot by saying this and claim the cop is always right (which additionally is completely irrelevant to the argument anyway) there\\'s something wrong with your comprehension. \"doesn\\'t matter how. Insignificant the offense\" the offense is assaulting an officer of the law you dense idiot, that\\'s what it\\'s been about the entire time. Truly you must be a troll, got me though, good job.

Just Acringy way to try to brag about smt on the internet to a stranger. Pathetic and sad.  >My family fought in every single war since before the US was even founded and still colonies. In the War of Northern Aggression, I had kin on both sides fighting. My two great-great-great uncles, they were the two oldest children, fought with the Missouri Partisan Rangers in the Confederate Army due to the Union invading Missouri. Said Union Army rampaged throughout the state and ended up on my great-great-great-great grandmother\\'s farm. They burned it to the ground then gang raped her. My great-great-great grandfather had a pistol put to his head by the colonel in charge of the regiment and was told to make a choice. He could serve in the Union Army or he could die where he stood. He was 16 at the time. His two oldest brothers took part in The Payback on the Union Army\\'s killing of Confederate soldier families and were tried as horse thieves. They weren\\'t accorded prisoner of war status under the Articles of War and hung for their participation in the battle. My great-great-great grandfather told us to never honor his service because he was forced murder and pillage fellow Missourians in an unjust war. We were to honor his brothers\\' service.  Both of my grandfathers fought in WWII. One was in the 101st AB and the other flew with the 703d Bombardment Squadron as a waist gunner in a B-24 Liberator. His pilot was none other than Jimmy Stewart and successfully completed the 30 mission requirement. My grandfather was awarded a Bronze Star with V device and 5 stars. Each star represented every successful bombing campaign he was a part of.  Still highly irrelevant to this topic, and even more cringy. Moreover, A LOT of families in europe has Ancestors that fought in both world wars, mine included, and it doesn\\'t mean much.  >As you can see I know more about history then you ever will. You can be ignorant towards me, but remember that my family and their buddies fought to free France twice. I didn\\'t mention my great-great grandfather that served in WWI in the US Navy on the USS Rochester as the chief water tender either.  Now let me tell you about my father. He served in Vietnam from 1966-1967 in a war that France started. He was drafted and ordered to kill men, women, and children or he and his buddies would be killed. I remember his flashbacks and him screaming for medivacs for the 63 men that died in the Mekong Delta out of a platoon of 66 men. All because France couldn\\'t let go of their colonial possession. Do you know what the US government did to recognize his and his buddies service? Those that survived were spat on and made to be ashamed to have worn the uniform of the US military. They were denied VA benefits for the PTSD, Agent Orange, etc... For my dad\\'s service all he got was a flag and a tombstone. He was denied full military honors because he wasn\\'t awarded a bronze star. At the time of his death, the US government cut the military back so bad that they couldn\\'t bury all of their veterans with full military honors. All because your country refused to let Vietnam be an independent nation.  I pity you and your kind that spit on the memories and the families of those that served, bled, and died for your freedom. When France needs help in the future from the problems of your own making I will be sure to rally support to not send aid. In fact, I will be arguing for the removal of all US service members from Europe and the return of all of our war dead. You aren\\'t worth any more blood and bodies. Now kindly go fuck yourself.   Same as before, and needless to say that, if us european can only but be thankfull to USA for WW1 and 2, we can still remind you that your help came at a high price (Marshall plan) that helped USA to become the 1st world power.    116,516 deaths for ww1 and  416,800 for ww2, that is quite a lot indeed, but far less than USSR, Germany and France (talking only about military deaths here, although civilan deaths shoudn\\'t be ignored.  Needless to say USA helped France in ww2 not to save it, but to save themselves by preventing a german victory that would have made US the last stnding enemy after Uk.

Regarding patriotism it would have to be defined in a way that don´t enter in conflict with “teamwork and cooperation” or the principles of the enlightenment, and usually isn´t defined that way (neither nationalism). We could enter a deep discussion about the meaning of the word “country” and it´s relationship with culture, and therefore how patriotism would have to be defined to not considering other people in other countries “less of a priority” or how loving your country wouldn´t imply loving other people less, we would also have to question ourselves if an abstract concept (or a physical piece of land or territory) do deserve to be loved as well to agree on the differences between patriotism and nationalism. In any case I much prefer a single culture based on the principles of the enlightenment than different cultures (different countries), of course a single culture isn´t how the world is right now, but I prefer to defend what I think would be good rather than defend an imperfect existing model just because it is under the attack of an even worse model.  The problem with trying to associate a movement with many other things that are not part of it and calling anyone who disagree with a few of them “retarded” (some people would acuse you of ableism for that) is that people aren’t going to be convinced by that nor are going to take you seriously for that matter.   A big problem with feminism is that is an ideology that convinces people that whoever don’t agree with them completely are deeply morally/ethically flawed, and therefore their ideas and opinions can be discarded without consideration. Your approach is much the same, you also consider yourself as in possession of the truth, the main difference is that you consider anyone who disagrees with you, even if only on a few things on a long list, as mentally impaired (and therefore their opinions can be discarded too).

I think about a decade or so ago, things were by and large much more liberal. People were focused on more individual level diversity, breaking down expectations placed on people, letting people choose their own path in life. That sort of thing. (As an example, universal health care is touted as making it easier for people to open up businesses).   But over the last decade or so, things have changed. I think the left has moved away from being liberal, and is now more progressive. And there IS a distinct difference. The former is about freedom and choice and individuality, and the latter is about results and statistics and ratios. Now, I don\\'t think that\\'s permanent. I think a big part of that is because progressivism (especially something like Critical Theory) plays VERY well in 140 (now 280, but the same idea goes) characters.

Why do you think KIA has an explicit prohibition against \"Dear Diary, today I was banned from r/insertsubhere REEEEEE\" posts?  Because that was literally one of the many random things this sub was flooded with at one point.  The point system was proposed by KIA community members as a solution to the problem of KIA mods having arbitrary discretion over how they enforced the rules and not making it clear what is and isn\\'t against the rules.  The mods basically said \"heres a thread, guys, feel free to come up with the best system to fix this problem\" and the point system was just that.  The KIA mod team are among the only subreddits in the history of this website who took complaints of moderator transparency and discretion seriously enough to make their rules regarding what is and isn\\'t on topic as explicit and transparent as possible, and host regular feedback and voting threads in response to criticism.  Few other subs anywhere remotely this size have mod teams who give two shits about people getting \"unfairly\" banned.  Since as it turns out, for every 1 person with a legitimate point there are 100 trolls with throbbing hateboners who will find literally any reason to complain about anything.  Case in point, an explicit and transparent system telling you exactly what the rules are in clear and no uncertain terms and even allowing you to completely ignore them by making a self-post still isn\\'t enough to forestall this latest round of \"ermagerd mods r nazis\" bitching.  As far as I can tell, every mod team gets so fucking jaded dealing with this cancer on a daily basis that they just give up entirely.

Sure, CNN is biased toward their corporate -- NOT progressive -- agenda and some criticism of Trump is unfounded. But Trump makes himself look like an idiot most of the time.   He doesn\\'t understand issues or process or the constitution he swore to protect. Remember when he wanted to take individuals\\' guns away without due process? Remember when he said tariffs are good because the exporting country pays them, when importers and US consumers actually pay tariffs? Plus, he constantly contradicts himself -- even in the same sentence -- without any help from the media.   Trump:   > In my plan, (taxes on the rich are) going down, but by the time it\\'s negotiated, they\\'ll go up.  He sure knows how to con people, though, which is what he\\'s been doing for decades. Technically Trump lost money on all his scams, because he\\'d have made more money investing his inheritance in the market. Like everything else about him, Trump\\'s business success is a ruse. So he\\'s not that smart, is he?   > The media brainwashes people into getting all riled up about politics so that we hate our neighbour.  This is exactly what Trump does when he blames everything on Democrats, no matter how outlandish. Death toll in PR: Democrats. Migrant caravan: Democrats. Mail bombs: Democrats. Legislative gridlock while Republicans hold both houses: Democrats.   He sicks his crowds on journalists at every rally, even as one of his followers is sending bombs out. He offers to pay the legal bills for followers who assault protesters. He celebrates a Republican candidate for assaulting a journalist. Trump is the epitome of the us-versus-them mentality. It\\'s never his fault -- always someone else\\'s.   Crucially, violence against his opponents is OK, but criticism of him is not. If you say nice things about Trump, then no matter what else you do, you\\'re a good guy. But if you oppose him whatsoever, then you\\'re an enemy. It\\'s not about principle; it\\'s about personal loyalty. That\\'s far closer to how the Nazis operated than anything CNN does.  As for economic conditions, real wage growth is virtually nonexistent, but all of the positive trends started under Obama, so the only thing Trump can say is that he hasn\\'t fucked it up yet. Except, his one major economic policy, tariffs, are doing much more to hurt the economy than help. And his only major legislative accomplishment is a massive tax break for the rich that will bankrupt the US just like he\\'s bankrupted so many of his own companies -- including a fucking casino! -- not to mention all the small contractors he never paid.   I notice you don\\'t cite the stock market rally, which Trump constantly took credit for, because all the gains from this year were just wiped out, but Trump isn\\'t taking credit for that, is he?  Recently, Trump claimed he was going to pass a tax break for middle-income families --  which somehow he forgot in the bill he actually signed -- before yesterday\\'s election. Except congress wasn\\'t sitting again before the election. So, not only is he benefiting the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor and middle class, but either he doesn\\'t know how laws are made or he\\'s betting that his followers don\\'t know either.   Even if CNN does lie and manipulate their audience, Trump is doing the exact same or worse. When he calls ANY media criticism of himself \"fake news\" and calls those who report on his lies and misconduct \"enemy of the people,\" he\\'s literally channeling Stalin. And some are lapping it up like warm milk.   The only reason Trump\\'s support is as high as it is is because his followers are also living in echo chambers, like Fox News (propaganda arm of the GOP), where any criticism is labeled \"fake\" regardless of merit and lies are repeated ad nauseam.   But don\\'t fool yourself, Trump lost the popular vote even with all the Republican gerrymandering, insecure voting machines, and voter suppression. Now, the three swing states he needed to win the electoral college just elected Democratic governors. When the House starts doing its job and investigating Trump\\'s misconduct, things are going to get a lot darker for Trump and Co. ', '', \"3. \\t\\tThat's you!

[...]  The Semitic mind, like the Celtic and Teutonic, seems to possess marked mystical inclinations; and the wealth of underground horror-lore surviving in ghettoes and synagogues must be much more considerable than is generally imagined. … Jewish Folklore has preserved much of the terror and mystery of the past, and when more thoroughly studied is likely to exert considerable influence on weird fiction.

People who just declare that Lovecraft was racist & leave it at that miss the point.

Even vampires have morally grey characters such as Regis and Detlaff, which is an unfair enough thing to say since they\\'re not human and have very different ways of living, being very much more creatures of instinct than what humans are.  Of the monsters in game most of them are more like animals than anything, killing for food rather than out of terror, and the exceptions to that are often being controlled by something else. Geralt specifically mentions he doesn\\'t kill sentient monsters just because, trying to find a way to solve the problem involving them rather than just stabbing them until they stop moving. There are numerous examples of monster contracts where said monster did what it did because a group of humans decided to start shit in the first place. See the male troll in W2 that\\'s mourning his wife the local humans killed for being a troll, or the succubus in W3 who killed some guards because they attacked her first, or many of the ghosts that are only ghosts because someone fucked them over in life.  The single most evil creature in the entire game is probably something so powerful that you quite literally can\\'t kill it. You can trick it and defeat it through a technicality, but that\\'s it. You never in any standing hope have a chance at actually fighting and killing it since it\\'s near enough the actual embodiment of evil in the universe rather than an actual living creature, and what does it spend most of it\\'s time doing? Tricking people into making deals and selling their souls. Yes it can kill, yes it does kill, generally out of annoyance at someone wasting it\\'s time, but despite being actual evil and the most powerful being you will ever meet in the game it doesn\\'t just go around killing everything in sight just because it can.   Even the Unseen Elder you can meet in W3, which is probably the second most powerful being in the game, doesn\\'t randomly murder just because it can. You make it a point that unwanted attention on the vampires in general from what is happening would be a problem, despite vampires being so much more powerful than humans and yet it\\'s a point the Elder accepts that point. This is a creature that can literally move faster than even witchers can react to yet it agrees to helping because it doesn\\'t want things to cause trouble, and this comes after you do a quest where you see what just 2 \"normal\" Higher Vampires do against regular humans and you\\'re lucky if you fight and kill 10% of the soldiers there because the vamps just mow down everything without pause. The Elder is above even those 2 in power and it still decides that not fighting is the better option.  This is all of course stuff I don\\'t expect the show to deal with. Race doesn\\'t equal species for these people making the show, so the actual racism in the witcher world between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc will be probably ignored in favour of intra-species racism despite the outright stupidity that suggests when you have both actual different races in the world and monsters which are far more important threats.', '2. \\t[For anyone curious and unfamiliar with who Buck Angel is.](http://www.graphis.com/entry/3b30abbe-f9cc-446c-ba43-c1d422cf58fc/) I dare someone to look at this picture and tell me they knew this was a genetically born female.

Though the difference in standard deviation is small, such differences can have a huge effect on the number of outliers.  For example, in the model where IQ follows a normal distribution for each gender (mean 101.461 for boys with sd 15.235 and mean 99.681 for girls with sd 14.085), one would expect nearly twice as many boys as girls with an IQ above 130. To be precise, approximately 3.05% of boys and approximately 1.57% of girls would have an IQ of 130 or higher in this model. These differences would grow wider as one gets farther from the mean. For example, using the same model as the previous paragraph, one would expect more than six times as many boys as girls with an IQ of 160 or higher.

The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That\\'s entirely reasonable.   >They see the platform owners as \"hospitality organizers\".   That\\'s just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: \"People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to\". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn\\'t* their standard of conduct.  >For one, I don\\'t see google/twitter/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I\\'m not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email.  >Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn\\'t politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term \"illegal aliens\" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).  The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven\\'t been*. Google\\'s failure to learn isn\\'t a problem with the report.  >Thirdly, being transparent about why you\\'e censoring someone doesn\\'t really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\".   Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That\\'s the point. You have to do both, that\\'s why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: \"GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn\\'t like you.\"  >Fourthly, what if I don\\'t want these platforms to \"police tone\"?   Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It\\'s why you can\\'t just run up to someone and start screaming \"FAGGOT!!!!\" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It\\'s why the government is not allowed to engage in \"viewpoint discrimination\", but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won\\'t stop screaming.  >Fifthly, if there is a problem with \"tone\", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?  They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn\\'t fit.  Is fifthly a word?...  >When Germany censors things it\\'s to \"make online spaces safer\", but when \"dictatorial leaders\" want to do so it\\'s to \"improve their methods of control\".

Moderation doesn\\'t require that content be removed. Slashdot for example, despite having moderation, never removed any comments.

I disagree that this is something that should be the responsibility of the people who run the platform. The platform administrators should concern itself with things that destabilize the platform, and provide tools so the users themselves can control the content they see.  > These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are private communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds.  Usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. The ISP Usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren\\'t removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn\\'t filter. And while some groups were moderated, others weren\\'t; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. If you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering.  Usenet\\'s technical considerations aside, I think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines. If something is actually illegal (in the \"forward to the FBI upon removal\" sense), or a court orders its removal, then the admins can pull it.  > The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies haven\\'t been. Google\\'s failure to learn isn\\'t a problem with the report.  Perhaps not, but it may suggest that being politically neutral is one of those things that sounds easy but in practice is really hard or impossible.  > Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It\\'s why you can\\'t just run up to someone and start screaming \"FAGGOT!!!!\" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them.  True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction?

We DID vote for him because Hillary was worse. But the shocking thing is as bad as his foreign policy is, it's actually BETTER than most mainstream politicians prior to it. Seriously. ISIS is on the run. North Korea is more receptive than they've been in decades. We haven't been dragged into any Iraqs or Afghanistans.  The economy is fucking excellent. Black unemployment isn't at record lows like they're saying, but it IS extremely low.  Trump hasn't expanded or engaged in policies like drone strike assassinations like Obama did, which everyone seems to forget about. He's had possibly the most peaceful presidency is decades.  Now don't get me wrong, he's also done a lot of bad things. He's continued to egg on like left(although they're mostly egging on themselves). He's offensive as all fuck. He's fucking with education funding which was the last thing we need right now. And his border policies while an improvement are mired in scandals because even he's not sure how to follow through on this in an ethical way.  My point is, we voted for him expecting a metaphorical grenade to throw at the establishment(none of us want actual violence. We just wanted to shake things up). Instead we got a surprisingly decent president in spite of it all. I'll be voting for him again next time around.  He's doing a good job. Let's no kid ourselves.

Did you not read the part about white women who I listed as one of the two groups that always pushes sjw, communist and feminist bullshit?  I think you are just projecting with your bullshit when you are willing to create a strawman argument that I didn't say.  Don't give me that dogwhistle nonsense.  SJWS do tend to be of these two backgrounds primarily, you can try to make up whatever rationalizations you want in order to hand-wave the presence of only one group away but it won't change the facts!  Also if you don't think that certain country is an ethnostate then you are beyond naive. The formation of that country even blatantly stated it was formed as a homeland for that one group!  You don't see that country taking in any refugees yet their people constantly say that America needs to open its border to refugees.   They are a hypocritical ethnostate and that is blatantly obvious to anyone who has eyes and ears.\", \"8. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou literally are ignoring facts to say it is only white people who are the bulk of people behind sjw shit when in reality they are only one of the two most prominent groups.  Also for the record, who the fuck said that I am white?  &#x200B;  I am Asian. I see some Asian people do sjw shit too if they live in California but they are not part of the two biggest groups who push sjw shit though.  Stop trying to use your strawman of evil juice to discount facts.  &#x200B;  Anyone who cares about human rights has a problem with the cruel treatment of Palestinians by their authoritarian ethnostate neighbors who always can use the anti-semitism card as their golden shield when anyone even calls them out on their hypocrisy or makes a legit criticism.  Many of their expats do advocate for opening borders in western nations yet at the same they fully support denying all refugees in their country.  Also,  American and Europeans Jews aren't a monolith of leftists who all hate Israel and want mass migration everywhere, there are many right leaning expats among their ranks who somehow think it is okay to push open borders for other western countries but not for their own country of Israel.  &#x200B;\", \"12. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKeep on making your evil juice strawmans.  You can't seem to understand actual demographics of sjws and will stick in your head in the sand to lie that it is mainly white men and women.   You also obviously seem to think that there are no legitimate criticisms of Israel anywhere so it is a waste to even discuss anything with those who are so Zionist that they are willing to forgo all facts.  Hope their Defense Force is at least paying you for your stalwart defense of their human rights violations and their hypocrisy.\", '5. \\t\\t\\t\\tLmao are you retarted just reread what I wrote and give it another go.', \"6. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYer a retard, 'arry!\", '', \"5. \\t\\t\\t\\tWhite privilege is all they have left.

No one can complain about rules being enforced or blame others for their own behavior.  I did hear the dialogue. I heard calm explanation from the ref and escalating emotion from Williams.
