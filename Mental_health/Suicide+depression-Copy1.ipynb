       " 'i have no idea how to deal with my best friend is suicidal thoughts anymorerecently  i have been really overwhelmed with my best friend  i always knew she had clinical depression and thoughts about suicide  but now it gets too much for me i am an almost years old girl and she is   i can not do much except write with her  because she lives     km away in another state  i feel so powerless  because i can not go to her and just give her a hug   but i gave my best and always stayed by her side  even if it is via social media  the last days  something was a bit different  yesterday and today  she blocked me on all social media to  protect me   she also blocked every other contact  she never reacted like that  even at her worst times  some months ago  when she also wanted to commit suicide  she did not block me and talked with me at this point  i think i should give you a bit background information  i am trying to keep it short  because it is a very long story  so i am leaving out a lot of details last year  she broke with her long term boyfriend of years up  she fell in love with her male best friend and tried a relationship with him  but they did not match and broke up  the reason why she fell in love with him was because her long term boyfriend almost treated her like her parents like taking out his stress from work on her  he did not beat her and he apologized  but it was already too late   her parents are both alcoholics and her mother is a narcissist  so she had a very rough childhood  her mother always manipulated her and later her boyfriend  because of her mother  they both grew dependant on each other  in my opinion  you could call their relationship unhealthy  they both drag each other down  because they are both individuals with low self esteem and are way too dependant of each other  she also thinks she owes him her life  because he prevented her suicide  she planned to kill herself after her th birthday after the break up  her boyfriend insulted her and threatened with suicide to get her back  he later apologized and then tried to get her back  but my best friend did not want to get together with him  because she had to deal with stress at school for her finals and with her depression  he told her that he can not wait forever and later said that he found another woman that he likes this triggered her first suicide attempt  i tried to talk with her and stayed by her side  when it did not get better  i talked with her other best friend and he called then the police  they sent her to the er and she got stronger medication everything got better  her ex boyfriend told her he just wanted to make her jealous and it got quiet for a while  this month  everything got worse  she always stayed in contact with her ex  but suddenly  he told her that he does not love her anymore  later they met again and she told me that they kissed and had sex  a few days ago  he blocked her and told her he does not want to hurt her anymore  she was devastated  but he unblocked her a few days later she talked to a lot of other friends for advice and was determined to fight for him  i also tried to support her  even if i am not fond of their relationship  she wanted to talk with him on tuesday about their future  their feelings and that they should try to be happy without being dependant on the other person yesterday  we talked about how she could make herself happy like finding a new hobby  everything was okay  but suddenly  she told me that she wants to give up and it is useless to fight  shortly after the topic of the conversation changed  she blocked me and every other contact on her list  i wrote her male best friend immediately  who told her parents and called the police  the police came  but they did not sent her to the er this time  her friend stayed over the night  she unblocked me  i did not write her to let her calm down  and it got a little better today  i decided to write her  because i was concerned about her  we had a normal conversation  even if she was still depressed  this changed immediately when her male best friend leaved  because he needed to visit relatives in another city  she told me how she wanted to kill her mother and then herself  so her ex boyfriend could be finally happy  i tried to calm her down  but then she blocked me again on social media and told me she gives up and wished me farewell again  i reached to her best friend  who gave me her parent is number  i explained them the situation and they thanked me  but i think they blocked me after that i am really really scared what will happen now  she wrote me two hours ago and did not seem very happy that i told her parents about her suicidal intent  i did not have a chance to answer her  because she blocked me immediately after she messaged me i do not know what will happen now and i am so scared   i am scared that she is not alive anymore and i will never see her again  we wanted to meet each other next week  i do not know how to cope with everything   my heart beats like crazy  as if i ran a marathon  and i just want to cry  she is my best friend since almost years  i always tried to help her  even if i just listened  when i had my stupid teenage problems  she was also there for me and understood me i thought i got pretty good at dealing with her depression  but now it is just too much for me  i feel so stupid  why did i message her today  i knew that she still felt depressed  i feel so guilty  even if i did not to anything wrong   but there is a little voice in my head that says it is my fault  i just    do not know what to do  i never felt so desperate  weak and scared ',\n",
       " 'how i wish i can dieyesterday  i nearly drowned at the beach  my friend saved me  so i went home  and did some reflections  so what i died yesterday  i can feel nothing  even if i have regrets  i can no longer feel any regrets  my conscience  gone forever  in a few minutes  so what if there is pain  my lungs were filled up with salt water   it burns  but the pain does not last and i will have no memory of the pain  so what if i had things unresolved  i just die  i will never feel the future  my brain can never feel regret simply because i am dead  so what if i had never done anything worthwhile  i am dead   dead do not feel emotional pain  death is not so bad ',\n",

almost divorced months later while i was on duty someone on base broke into my house and raped my wife at gun point trial just ended wifes been treating me like im nonexistent more than usual since now shes left after a fight and titlebackgroundever since i was a kid ive felt like ive just had a wall blocking me from doing anything great outside of that my mother went to prison when i was for armed robbery and i wemt to live with my grandma  when i was my dad died from what i was told was a car wreck i dont remember my next few years but apparently i took that really hard and thats why i dont remember  growing up i had a few friends that was fine because they were good friends but eventually we all got into some drugs  i myself started smoking weed when i was and continued doing that and snorting pills all through high school where my grandma treated me like i was worthless and my always in trouble sister like an angel but thats not to important  around my mom got out of prison and i reconnected with her and ended up moving in with her my junior year of highschool  while working a job at a rest stop in high school a person i met there use to know my dad and he told me the truth that my family hid from me growing up that he had died of a heroin overdose at someones house and instead of calling an ambulance they put him in his car on the side of a road  at the end of my junoir year i decided to join the marine corps  my senior year i met my wife and we started dating in february she was cute and all but she seemed to just think noone cared about her when everyone did but that they were just out to get her so to speak  july of that year i went to boot camp graduated went to combat school and mos schools beaufort i got to my duty station a year later while still dating my wife and every thing was pretty ok i thought  in y first month of being in my new squadron the people i worked with hated me because i had a miscomunication one time with one of my sgts and he slandered me because of it so i got sent to other places for weeks at a time so i wouldnt bother them and as the next year and a half went on i built my way up and got some recognition that i knew what i was doing and was good at the job but only guy really stood up for me and thought i was the best one in the shop to take his spot when he left but everyone else disregarded it no matter how many times i proved it  in december of me and my wife got married i kind of assumed we werent ready but i was tired of being away from her  the one major thing was that she never cared about me in our relationship only herself because she says if she doesnt care about herself noone else will which i tried to prove wasnt true  within the first month of us living together she found old porn links on my phone and said she wanted a divorce and left our bedroom i followed after her afew seconds later and found her sitting in the living room which at that point she attacked me and i retreated back to the bedroom  when she came in after me she turned on the light and i was covered in her blood  iwas only wearing shrts  i started to freak out and have a panick attack just standing there screaming at the top of my lungs i was so scared and then she passed out  once i regained my compusure as best i could i started screaming i was gonna call while trying to find my phone when she grabbed me and held me while i went into another screaming fit and passed out when i woke up in the morning i found a note saying she had swallowed a bottle of asprin or something to kill herself so i shook her hoping she hadnt died and she woke up and we just kinda went back to normal im the kind of person that doesnt want to let anyone in on there problems  why im here instead of with a friend  so i had to leave to go to work right after that so i wouldnt be ua and have to be asked about it so i just went on auto pilot for the next week  about months later i left for weeks and when i came back i had duty over the memorial weekend so i would be gone for hours        memorial  while i was gone that night i was gonna go back to the house to see if my wife wanted to get food with me and decided not to since she said she was going to bed but during that time that i was going to go back and didnt one of our neighbors on base housing broke into our home and raped my wife at gun point  the next day after getting back from the hospital me and a friend went to the house after the police had left and talked to a few of my neighbors seeing who matched the descrition and they bpointed out a house to us so i plan was to go to the guys house before he left for work and wait to see if he was the guy and then beat him to death with my bestfriend but i ended up falling asleep because i was so stressed and hadnt slepy in hours and when i woke up that guy was caught  the next few months were rough  all my friends left on deployment while i stayed back with my wife so i told noone at my new squadron except my co what had happened  my wife seemed to grow distant from me and i always tried to help but she said she just wanted to move on with her life like it didnt happen so i tried to support that  when the court case came around this december i ended up spending the majority of it by myself standing outside because it was to much for me and everyone stayed with my eife upstairs  the only person that came and talked to me a few times was my father inlaw her dad  he helped a good bit with me and i feel like hes the only father figure ive ever had in my life  now that the trials over my wife told all her friends that i neglected her the whole time and never talked to her to wee if she was okay and that i just acted like it never happened  like she told me to do  and has started putting distance between us as in spending very little time with me and all of it with her friends  so now tonight i told her that i had to leave in months for weeks and she said that i didnt care about her and never listen to her and that she was leaving to go to a friends to stay  so now here i am in the dark drinking till sunrise while my wife stays with her friend and her husband who i have to work with tomorrow and im considering just getting hammered and running my car into a tree as fast as i can to just end it  ',\n",

pretend all is okay  but the truth is  i just want to stop living and commit a suicide  but i will not and i cannot figure out how to live on without suffering every day i am   i would say i am an intelligent and educated person  i mean  i used to be an interpreter and i still speak three languages  then i was forced due to low earnings to switch jobs and despite never being a programmer nor understanding programming at the beginning  i became a tester who is now capable of writing automatization tests  learned on my own   with a pretty good rate of discovering bugs too  plus as a female  i survive in like   male field  but to be honest  i do not mind that much  i might even prefer it and get along with my guys   i earn enough to live on my own  parents live far from bigger city that provides my sort of work  so i had to move closer   to support myself and lately even save some money  i have parents who love me  sounds peachy  right  yeah   i am also depressed  i fight it however i can  therapists and psychologists never helped  despite trying my best to  help them help me   they never managed to  though  believe me  i tried to let them help me  i tried to help myself too  absolutely any way i could think of or could google  nothing ever worked for long time  i take mild antidepressives  prescribed to me because i started gaining weight and having bouts of devouring everything around  partially due to corticoids i had to take due to my worsened asthma  that was like two years ago  i think i know the source of my unhappiness  i have a thing regarding being rejected  began when i was a little pipsqueak  some not exactly pretty bullying  but that is story for another day  i cannot stand being ignored when i am trying not to be and being rejected  i am still an intelligent and well behaved person  so i take it in stride in public and joke when it happens  i even try to understand the people  remember the  coids from last paragraph  yeah  if you know something about them  you can probably guess that i am very fat  not yet american level  cannot move  obesity  but i am pretty fat  this is not anorectic blahblah   i am a little bit over cm tall and weigh    god this is awkward  i weigh kilo  crap  it sounds serious  but there  i said it  and i am not going to delete it   i live in europe and this kind of weight is seen pretty morbid in here  you can probably imagine that my weight makes men not view me as a relationship material much  i cannot exactly dress awesomely either  not much fits  and that is the core of my problem  i always knew i was a  pair person   it was always simply the fact of my life  i always inclined to having that one person and then couple of friends that i liked  but that were outside  my circle   so to say  i require a man  to be with me  i had couple of relationships  but they all fell apart in time  they were not short ones    year   years   months   year   as i said  i am a pair person and that means my natural habitat is in a relationship  i bloom  i was told i become a sun and shine bright  and i can take on anything  even on this nasty bit of business called depression  i just find joy and suddenly  i can   live    i have many hobbies and i do a lot of stuff  but when i am single way too long  to give you an idea  it has been years since i have been single  not to mention without sex which is very important thing for me  and these two years have been full of hardships and problems   depression creeps in and i just    lose interest  last three months  when i am not at work  i mostly sleep  or read  or play games  or do whatever else i usually do  but it is mechanic and i prefer to sleep  to be  dead  just for a little while  last month or so  i do not even want to meet up with any of my friends  i prefer to be alone  i am ashamed of myself  of how i look and i am very fragile now  and i am terrified that they would judge me or say something nasty and that is not something    i would deal with at this moment  so i do not meet anyone  i go to work  i come home and    do something utterly useless  then go to work next day  on weekends  i sleep like   of those two days  do not go out in the meantime  maybe you ask why i do not do anything about my weight    i hate exercise and movement  it hurts and the  endorphins are flowing   never happened to me  six years ago i frequented gym for a year and actually became rather buff and good looking  then pneumonia came  i had to be stuffed with  coids and all went to shit  the point is though  i know what exercise does to me and i know i hate it even long term    diets  i survive and keep sleep at bay only with energy drinks  i despise coffee  hate it   without them  i can not concentrate at work  i am just too tired and i am nasty to others and careless  not something a tester should be  liter per day of that shit  guarana tablets do not work  coffeine tablets do not work  coffeine gums  neither  on top of that  i have awful cravings for sweet stuff  it is a problem    the reasons before are real  but they could theoretically be defeated  if it were not for a damn deeply ingrained spite against the nowadays  society is penchant for judging people based on their appearance  society wants you to be sporty  thin  beautiful  otherwise you are not worth anything  it makes me incredibly angry  spiteful  depressed and sad and it just awakens a tendency in me to revolt  to force people to accept me as i am  to not intentionally diet and exercise to lose weight  it is a little piece of shit  this thing  pardon my french  and it makes me a weak piece of shit too i am exhausted from fighting  fighting tiredness  fighting being fat  fighting bitterness from being alone  fighting to wake up every morning  fighting to smile  fighting to be seen as alive  fighting to joke around and laugh to not worsen the loneliness  i want to die  but i can not  remember the loving parents i mentioned in the beginning  i had suicidal thoughts since i was like   and at i decided that as long as my parents are live  i  will  not  commit  a  suicide  they love me a huge lot and it would cause them endless suffering if their daughter died and these two people  they just do not deserve that  whoever reads this  if anybody reads this    please  help  help me somehow  tell me how to gain a bit of respite  tell me how to do something better  what to try  tell me about ways you know  maybe at least one of them might provide a momentary relief from incessant headaches and suffering and allow me to regain some strength  if i am forbidden to die  then i at least need a break from suffering  last three months have been so exhausting and torturous that it is just a question of when i will collapse from this crippling loneliness and anxiety and not go to job one day  starting another even more miserable spiral downward that might just force me to do the thing i forbid myself to do  just because i am fat does not mean i am not a person who does not deserve love    i am a person who is difficult to help  i know  but i still ask for at least    recognition  effort for advise  i really do not expect anything ',\n",

graduation  was homeless for a while then  my papaw  who i looked up to  shot himself when i was   my drug addicted biological father drove into a tree and died the same year  been fighting depression my whole life  amp  trauma ptsd  this past year i was finally on the path i wanted to be  i have a girlfriend who loves me and has for almost years now  she pulled me out of addiction  amp  has never messed with drugs  she got her masters degree and is now a therapist who has been trying to help me deal with my trauma  i forgave my adoptive dad for what he put me through and we have a good relationship as well as the rest of my family now  i was finally feeling happy the past few years even with depression   if that makes sense  im in barber school and one of the top my teacher said hed ever had  which spoke volumes to me since hes owned and ran the college for   years  i was even the one teaching my classmates  only a few months of school left for me to graduate  i work the job i love at a vape shop  building coils  to make people healthier  i hadnt thought of suicide in years now  i never thought i was worth a shit but i slowly was being shown i was  as my girlfriend would tell me  i survived my struggles  amp  now i can be happy  but as i found out   the sun can only shine for so long  june th of this year  a tuesday  i woke up late for class so i hurried to get showered and ready  i dont remember much of that day now but i do remember some  tuesday was our monday so i had worked late the night before and overslept  by the time i was heading to my car it was      class starts at     and goes till     p m   amp  is a minute drive from my town to a bigger city  i had to get gas also so i was in a rush  the gas station was only miles away  i drove down the parkway towards the gas station at mph  speed limit is mph  without my seatbelt on cause i was in a hurry  it was sunny and warm  the fresh air smelled great and i knew it had to be a good day  i got a mile down the parkway in the fast lane   then the next thing i remember was someone saying ive called   the ambulance is coming  who can i call for you  immediately i remembered my moms phone number  i lived with her and my adoptive dad  amp  little sister so i could get back on my feet  so i gave him her number and asked what happened  the next memory of that morning i have is the helicopter noises  the next memory is days later in pain i have never felt  on my way to my second set of surgeries  hours of surgery total  lots of blood transfusions and days until i can remember anything more  a semi truck wasnt looking that morning and pulled straight into the fast lane in front of me  i hit them at mph  nobody understands how i didnt die  my engine was pushed through the dash causing me to be stuck  my right hip  amp  pelvis was shattered  my left hip  amp  pelvis severely broke  my dominant hand  the right one  broken along with my right wrist and thumb  a broken nose  my right knee bashed open exposing my knee cap  amp  a lot of glass in my face  its been months now  amp  im still in a hospital bed in my parents front room  i cant walk or bear weight but can sit up in my wheelchair for a half hour or so  i have to learn to walk again when the time comes but its all seemed so far away  last month my x rays showed my hip muscles are turning to bone which may require more surgery if i cant get it stopped  im in constant pain  amp  supposed to take pain medication  amp  muscle relaxers times a day along with a lot more medications  i fought to get away from opiates and now im forced back on them  i will more than likely not recover enough to be a barber now because of needing full motion of my right hand  amp  needing to stand all day  i have hated myself for waking up late that morning everyday now  my struggle didnt end like i thought  it became harder and worse  i am forced to lay here watching life move on for everyone else but stand still for me  i wish i didnt survive now  amp  i want to end it all now  today was all i could take and i dont know if i can struggle anymore  i tried to be positive  amp  strong but im tired of having to be strong  the shoes that i have walked miles of my life in have no more soles from the weight ive had to carry  amp  the road feels like its at an end  i dont know how to start again  i dont know how to smile  i dont know how to want to live when this isnt living  im crying out for help and i feel like no one has listened  my other traumas have come back  most that i made myself forget  the night terrors are killing me  amp  im terrified to sleep for i dont know what ill see in my dreams  ive always told myself that im needed on this planet  amp  i might not know why yet but ill find out one day  that im strong enough to stay and fight another day  but what if ive just prolonged the inevitable  the sad truth that the sun will shine brighter for everyone who knows me if i go  because everybody has

bordering on schadenfreude  relationship and intimacy issues  self hate  paranoid about others  jealousy being a plague of the mind  self doubt preface  im writing this on my phone  no autocorrect  so spelling and formating is not good  my english is not that good either  so feel free to correct me i dont have any plans for it  and probably lack courage  but ive been thinking about it daily  or at least a couple of times a week  for such a long time it just feels like a part of me its strange how the bodys instinct is self preservation yet my brain finds comfort and relish in pursuing my own mental anguish like a hummingbird looking for nectar  the suicidal fantasies feel so soft and sweet and comforting  like a warm blanket wrapping around me  safe i dont know why it feels so good  is it because its a reassurance of the fact that its always an option  or because i enjoy this self influcted schadenfreude   if you could call it that the moment i start thinking about realitically i hit a wall  ill start thinking about all of the statistics showing how most suicides fail  and how ill fail too because im a plain jane whose not an exception  surviving suicide will actually be worse than dying  in my eyes  because of all of the unwanted repercussions that would make me regret it and seek suicide even more  my life is not objectively bad  in fact id say it is average  i hope im not being arrogant when im saying that i might have potential to do better than now  and even being in the same solar system  or even orbit   as all of the people i look up to and admire  one can always improve  but i dont know how far i can reach  or if theres even a limit  now  there is only one thing that keeps me from being better in any way  myself   the norwegian word for suicide is selvmord which translates to self murder  now  the degree and the way i think of suicide graetly varies  but i almost always want to inflict some damage on this part of me  these fantasies of suicide may stem from my desire for killing this part of myself  this part is the bad part of me that ive managed to co exist with for the majority of my life  but i can feel her slowly dominating the controls of my body in a noticable manner  my thoughts are a bit more paranoid in that im throughoutly convinced all of my friends and even some of my loved ones genuinely despise me  every little action they make can be interpretted as them scheeming against me or making fun of me  i dont know why anyone would take advantage of me because theres nothing good to take from me  despite not being new fears  the fact that they are so frequent now and that i cant shake them off is scaring me  some days i am convinced even my dear sister detests my prescence  there are people i honestly want to be with  and i wouldve  if it wasnt for that warning  long unecessary rant ahead lt rant gt when i was younger i didnt have a large variety of potential friends  so i anchored myself to the one girl who could actually bear my existance  it honestly was a relief  because i only has one friend in kindergarten  she was the only other dark skinned girl there  sadly left before it was over   the rest bullied me and made me feel terrible about myself for things that i couldnt change things that defined me  while being in such a dark place socially she shone like a star in the distance  the closer i got to her  the clearer things got  you thought i would say brighter  right    i mightve been a not so smart kid  still am   but i knew she was using me  she told me one day that she got bullied a bit herself  combined with the way she treated me like she was above me  and how she immediately forgot about me when she was offered an opportunity to be with other girls  i felt used  my long lost friend from kindergarten returned in fifth grade and she was immediatley loved by everyone  including me  my other friend  lets call her eva now to differentiate  was furious and was being mean and bitter about her to me  she had built a small empire in the schoolyard  and it was crumbling quickly  eva was desperate for her power and tried to turn everyone against my friend  failed   i have fortunately burnt all bridges with her  we dont go to the same school now  but my friend does  were still close friends  currently bffs   eva is still a terrible person who i can not stand  this experience at least taught me about how to spot the bad apples  and that you should not be witv someone out of desperation   lt  rant gt the reason why i mentioned this event  yikes  its so rambly and bitter about f cking primary drama lmao  is because i am now not very trusting of people and fear intimacy  this ties back to everyone hating me  its actually fucking crazy how my mind will stretch and bend like its bloody playing twister to find ways in which people hate me  picture this  youre sitting on the bus  just minding your own business  you see two people whispering to eachother and you catch one of them briefly looking at you  a sinking feeling hits you  theyre taliking about you  about how youre so useless  how even your family thinks youre so whiny and dumb and self obssesed  about how ugly you look  the strangers have finished talking and are now looking at eachother and laughing  you see  you fucking see you dumbass  youre nothing but prime entertainment for them  a walking trainwreck that people poke fun of for instant dopamine  it would almost be a shame if you killed yourself  who would these people talk about  youre so good at pleasing people  its about the best you could do  another voice in your head joins the conversation  who said they ever think about you  god youre so self obsessed  of course people dont always think about you even if youre trash  they  like you  have their own lives to live  they dont care at all so shut up  only someone of actual worth would be able to catch their attention like that  or someone likewise  but in hideousness  youre so unremarkable in both ways they didnt even notice you  now that i think of it  they mightve laughed at just that at this point youre so immersed in these thoughts you dont notice the strangers leaving  or that your destination almost passed thats the type of thought processes i can have in everyday situations that are triggered by such simple gestures  and i hate it  i hate it  i hate it im the most insecure person ive ever seen  looking at myself in the mirror makes me nauseous from the sheer hideousness from inside and out  even if i believe  i know  albeit in denial out of fear of confrontation  that no one cares and theyre just faking it i dont want to cause them harm by talking about my feelingsmy suicide will cause harm too  no matter what i do there will be a mental battle in mind well  this might be the most dramatic thing that ive ever written  it makes me rather embarassed  despite that  im trying to push beyond because ill explode  or implode   i already told my friend about my suicidal thoughts and she was very worried  it made me guilty to make her feel that way as she does not deserve it  the internet is the only place i can vent this into  i feel selfish in that i want people to read this because i desperately need a second opinion  writing this made me realise all of the things that i did not know where affecting me worst thing is  this is just a scratch on the surface  like the fact that im not always sad and unmotivated  and can in fact be the opposite to the point where i think im cured and somewhat of a good person   id rather not plague
